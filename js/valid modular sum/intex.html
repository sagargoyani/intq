    <title>Valid modular sum</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>You are given with an array arr of size N.</p>
    <p>
      Your task is to tell whether there exists a sub-array with a valid modular
      sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let x[i] denote the number of times the ith bit is set in the binary
      representation of numbers in a sub-array arr[l, l+1, ...., r], where 1 <=
      l <= r <= N.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modular Sum is defined as a 10 digit number formed by digits 0, 1, 2. The
      ith digit in modular sum is equal to x[i] mod 3, where mod denoted the
      remainder when x[i] is divided by 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      A modular sum is said to be valid if all the digits of the modular sum are
      exactly the same.

    <p>[5, 2, 3, 1, 3] => Yes</p>
    <p>[8, 6, 1, 3] => No</p>
